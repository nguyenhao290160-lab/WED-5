          What is an Affiliate Link?
        </h2>
        <p>
          TechDeals participates in various affiliate marketing programs, including the Amazon Associates Program and other retailer affiliate networks. This means that when you click on a product link on our website and make a purchase, we may earn a small commission at no additional cost to you.

          How Does This Work?
        </h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>When you click on a product link from TechDeals, you are directed to a retailer's website</li>
          <li>If you purchase the product (or other products) within a certain timeframe, we receive a commission</li>
          <li>This commission is paid by the retailer, not by you</li>
          <li>Your purchase price remains the same whether you arrive via our affiliate link or directly</li>
